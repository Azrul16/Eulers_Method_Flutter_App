# Euler's Method Solver App

## Overview

The **Euler's Method Solver App** is a Flutter application designed to solve real-world problems utilizing Euler's Method. The app allows users to visualize solutions through interactive graphs and offers comprehensive tools to explore various predefined problems while customizing parameters for a dynamic problem-solving experience.

## Features

### Predefined Problems

The application includes several real-world scenarios, including:

- **Population Growth**
- **Chemical Reaction**
- **Projectile Motion**
- **RC Circuit**
- **Thermal Dynamics**

### Graph Visualization

- Interactive graphs are generated using [fl_chart](https://pub.dev/packages/fl_chart), allowing users to visualize the results of their computations effectively.

### Custom Input Parameters

- Users can modify key parameters such as:
  - **Step size**
  - **Number of steps**

This flexibility enables users to tailor their solutions to specific needs and explore the effects of different inputs.

### Readable Problem Descriptions

- Each problem comes with a clear and concise description, along with the solution displayed in an easy-to-read format.
